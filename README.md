## Introduction
The RSA-Secure-QR-Generator-Scanner application combines the convenience of QR codes with the security of RSA encryption. Users can securely encode text, URLs, or other data into QR codes, ensuring that the content is encrypted. Additionally, users can scan and decrypt QR codes to retrieve the secure information.

This project is ideal for applications requiring secure data transmission via QR codes, such as secure information sharing, payment systems, and confidential messaging.

## Features
#### QR Code Generator:
-Generate QR codes from any text, URL, or data input.
-Automatically encrypts the input using RSA encryption before generating the QR code.




## Installation

As the QR Code Generator is a client-side application, you can use it directly without any installation. However, if you want to host it locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaushaldhrangad/qr-code-generator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd qr-code-generator
```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Why RSA?

RSA encryption ensures that sensitive information encoded in QR codes remains secure, making the application ideal for use cases like secure data sharing, payment systems, and personal data protection.

 ## Feature - Under Development

I am pleased to announce that we are currently working on an innovative and powerful scanner feature for our website! This feature will enable users to easily scan QR codes directly from their device's camera or upload a file. I am working hard to ensure a smooth and user-friendly scanning experience.
